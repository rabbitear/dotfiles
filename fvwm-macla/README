                             ====================

This is a 100 % keyboard driven Fvwm config. It aims to make window handling
efficient by making the keyboard commands easy to hit.

All window handling uses the AltGr (right Alt on the US keyboard) key as
modifier, to avoid conflicts with applications. AltGr is easy to reach, but
seldom used, except for local characters. The most frequently used commands are
the easiest to hit. For example, instead of using CTRL-F1,F2,F3,F4 to switch
workspace, AltGr-U,I,O,P is used instead. The "root menu" is called with
AltGr-L.

The window titlebar is replaced by a colored border; the color which depends on
the application. This actually improves the readability (IMHO), as the "real"
information comes closer to each other. Also it uses less screen space which is
crucial on a 12" laptop :-)

The patch modules/FvwmRearrange-disable_title_check.patch makes FvwmRearrange
work when the windows have no titlebar.

Feedback will be appreciated. You can mail me at mntnoe (@) gmail.com or post a
comment on my blog (mntnoe.com).

Happy tweaking,

BUGS

  They doesn't seem to cause trouble, however.
